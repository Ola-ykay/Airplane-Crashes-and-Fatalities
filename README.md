## Project Overview
This project explores over **5,000 airplane crashes** from 1948 to present, focusing on trends, fatality rates, crash locations, aircraft types, and other key aviation safety insights. The analysis was performed using **Microsoft Excel**, with an interactive dashboard to showcase findings.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to analyze historical airplane crash data to uncover patterns, trends, and key safety insights that can inform decision-making in aviation safety, design, and operations.

## Objectives
1. Identify Patterns: Analyze airplane crashes over time and across global locations to uncover recurring trends and anomalies.
2. Measure Fatality Rates: Evaluate the severity of each crash by calculating fatality rates and understanding the human impact.
3. Determine High-Risk Aircraft & Operators: Identify which aircraft types and operators are involved in the most crashes, highlighting potential safety concerns.
4. Visualize Crash Locations: Map crash sites and routes to detect geographical hotspots and identify regions with higher aviation risk.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Transformation & Visualization
- Power Query: Data cleaning & shaping
- Pivot Table: aggregation & KPI calculations
  
## KPIs
- Total Fatalities: The total number of people who lost their lives onboard the aircraft across all recorded crashes.
- Total Operators: The number of unique airline or aircraft operators involved in the crashes
- Fatality rate: The percentage of fatalities compared to the total number of people aboard.
- Ground Fatalities: The number of people on the ground who died as a result of the airplane crash
- Total Passengers: The total number of people who were aboard the aircraft across all incidents, including crew and passengers.

## ðŸ”ŽInsights
- Top 10 aircraft operator with fatalities
- Monthly total fatalities
- Total fatalities by location
- Total passengers per aircraft
- Month ground fatalities
- Flight routes
  
## Questions Explored

1. Which **aircraft type** is most commonly involved in crashes?
2. What are the **deadliest routes** or crash-prone locations?
3. How have **fatality rates** changed over time?

## Dashboard Features

- Clean, interactive layout built with **PivotTables**, **Slicers**, and **Charts**
- Visual breakdown of crash data by:
  - Year
  - Aircraft Type
  - Operator
  - Location
- Maps and filters for **routes** and **locations**
- Slicers: Month
